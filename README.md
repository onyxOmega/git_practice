Welcome to markdown.

I'm going to learn a little about how markdown works

### A list with html
<li> Some thing in a list
<li> Thing 2

### A numbered list with markdown
1. An item
1. Another item
1. A third item

### Bullet list with markdown
* Item 1: space it out
* Item 2
  + subitem

  + subitem
    + Sub subitem
      * Sub sub subitem
        * subitem?

Horizontal Rule
* * *
>block quote
- - -
***
*****

* a list item that has way to much stuff on one line.  
  etc. It just keeps going. But it still wraps nicely

You can also add stuff in html
<table>
    <tr>
        <td style="width:100px;">Foo</td>
        <td style="width:100px;">Bar</td>
    </tr>
</table>

    def method
      this is a method
      It's a codeblock
      etc
    end
